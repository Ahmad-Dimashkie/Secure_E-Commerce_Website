# Electronics & Gadgets E-Commerce Platform (Admin Module)

## Project Overview

This project is an **e-commerce platform** focused on electronics and gadgets. It provides administrative features to manage inventory, orders, products, and customers efficiently. While the customer-facing features are planned for future implementation, the current scope focuses on the **Admin Module**, enabling administrators to manage the platform's backend seamlessly.

## Key Features (Admin Module)

### Inventory Management
- **Real-Time Inventory Tracking**: Monitor stock levels across warehouses in real-time.
- **Inventory Reports**: Generate detailed reports on inventory turnover, popular products, and demand predictions.
- **Product Categories**: Manage at least 10 product categories, each with subcategories.

### Order Management
- **Order Processing**: Track and update order statuses (e.g., pending, shipped, delivered).
- **Returns Management**: Handle product returns, refunds, or replacements seamlessly.
- **Invoice Generation**: Automatically create invoices for orders.

### Product Management
- **Product Listings**: Add, update, or remove product details, including images, descriptions, and specifications.
